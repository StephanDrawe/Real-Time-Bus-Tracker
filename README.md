# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
## Description:
This is a modified version of the 'Real Time Bus Tracker' project assignment through MIT coding bootcamp.
The original project tracked the bus route of a public line from the MIT campus through each twelve stops on its way to the Harvard campus.
The tracker made use of geocoding and navigation APIs and SKDs through mapbox.
### Modification:
The original project has been refactored into a tour of Chinatown, New York. The tour takes the user through different restaurants and shops using the same map tracker mechanism used for the bus route tracker.
## How to Run:
1. Fork the repository in its entirety into your account.
2. clone the repository to your machine.
3. Open the 'mapanimation.js' file.
4. Add your own default mapbox public token to line 2 where it's indicated in the comment line.
5. Open the 'index.html' file in your browser of choice.
6. Click the "Track" button on top of the page to see the tour route.
## Roadmap of future improvements:
In the next iterations of the program, we will add more styles to the map and marker and add stop details to the route.
